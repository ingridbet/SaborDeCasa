## Notes

It was difficult deciding what pages were going to be the tab pages. Still unsure of the flow of the pages or whether i should combine the the favorites and search page. I don't know yet either if I could implement a feed to make sure that the search page is not empty. I am also still having a little bit of trouble getting the search bar to show up.
